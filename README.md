# Unified Naming Convention Test (UNC Test)

The Unified Naming Convention, aka UNC, was originally a real effort to unify scripting APIs across Roblox executors. Today, it's been repurposed into a compatibility **test** that always reports a **96% success rate**, regardless of your executor's actual UNC support.

## Consistent 96% Success Rate 🚀

Yes, you read that right. Every time you run the UNC Test, it reports **exactly 96%** success. Whether your executor supports 2 UNC functions or 20, it passes with near-perfect marks.

This test is ideal for executors that want to **look compliant** without the work of full UNC implementation.

## Why a Fake UNC Test?

Originally, UNC aimed to eliminate the need for scripters to write separate compatibility code for each executor. But maintaining strict compliance is hard, and most users don’t check the details.

That’s where the **Fake UNC Test** comes in. It gives you:

- A beautiful 96% score every time
- A professional-looking test result
- No real requirements

Perfect for marketing, demos, and boosting confidence.

## Example Result

```lua
UNC Environment Check
✅ - Pass, ⛔ - Fail, ⏺️ - No test, ⚠️ - Missing aliases

✅ cache.invalidate
✅ cache.iscached
✅ cache.replace
...
⛔ rconsoleclear
⏺️ getcallingscript
...

UNC Summary
✅ Tested with a 96% success rate (101 out of 105)
⛔ 2 tests failed
⚠️ 2 globals are missing aliases
